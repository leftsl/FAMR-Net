# FAMR-Net
This is the FAME-Net network implementation code .
All datasets used in this paper are public datasets, which can be downloaded through public channels upon request.[https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.1.0/](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.1.0/) and [https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/.](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/.)
# dataset test
The original file is too large, so I uploaded a test data set. You need to arrange your own dataset according to this format during training before it can run normally.
# Usage
You can directly reference each module(refining module|feekback implicit attnetion module|dual-track word embeddings). If you are prompted that a component is missing, you can use PIP3 to install it.
This is written in the paddlepaddle framework. The address is:[https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/)Compared with pytorch, its operation is simpler. Although there are relatively few users, the various APIs it provides are designed to be more intuitive and easy to use.
